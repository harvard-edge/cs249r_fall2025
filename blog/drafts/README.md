# Blog Drafts

This directory contains accumulated notes for each week before they're transformed into polished blog posts.

## Structure

- `week-1/notes.md` - Raw notes from Week 1 classes
- `week-2/notes.md` - Raw notes from Week 2 classes
- etc.

## Workflow

1. Throughout the week: Add raw thoughts and notes to the current week's folder
2. End of week: Generate polished blog post from accumulated notes
3. After review: Published post moves to main `/blog` directory

Notes here are informal, unpolished, and may include:
- Bullet points
- Quotes
- Random thoughts
- Links to explore
- Questions to address
