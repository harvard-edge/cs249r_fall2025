## Class Date: September 15, 2024
**Timestamp**: Added 2025-09-14

### Code Generation & SWE-bench Session

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Code generation with SWE-bench
- Benchmark importance in measuring AI progress
- Real-world GitHub issues as training/evaluation data

**Big Insight:**
"Benchmarks are everything - if you don't have good benchmarks, you can't measure progress"

**Technical Details:**
- Ofir demonstrated how SWE-bench uses real GitHub issues
- Focus on using actual software engineering problems for evaluation

**Student Discussion:**
- Student question: "Are we automating ourselves out of jobs?"
- This sparked significant class discussion about the role of AI in software development

**Key Takeaway:**
AI tools are making developers more productive, not replacing them - enhancement rather than replacement model
