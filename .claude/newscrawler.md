# News Crawler Instructions for CS249r: Architecture 2.0

## MISSION: Curate "AI for X" Industry News
Find articles about AI being used as a TOOL to improve systems, software, and hardware design - NOT about building systems FOR AI.

## CRITICAL DISTINCTION: "AI for X" vs "X for AI"

### ‚úÖ WHAT WE WANT: "AI for [System/Software/Hardware]"
Articles about using AI/ML as a TOOL to IMPROVE:

**Hardware Design:**
- AI designing chips better (AlphaChip layouts)
- AI optimizing EDA workflows (Synopsys DSO.ai)
- AI automating verification and testing
- AI improving manufacturing yield
- AI generating RTL/Verilog code
- AI optimizing place and route

**Software Optimization:**
- AI optimizing compilers (making GCC/LLVM better)
- AI improving code quality and debugging
- AI detecting performance bottlenecks
- AI optimizing database queries
- AI automating code refactoring
- AI improving algorithm efficiency

**System Performance:**
- AI optimizing cache hierarchies
- AI improving memory allocation
- AI scheduling processes better
- AI optimizing network protocols

### ‚ùå WHAT WE DON'T WANT: "[System/Software/Hardware] for AI"
Articles about building systems TO RUN AI:
- TPUs, NPUs, AI accelerators (hardware FOR AI)
- PyTorch, TensorFlow frameworks (software FOR AI)
- AI training infrastructure
- GPU clusters for machine learning
- CUDA/ROCm optimizations for ML workloads
- "AI PC" or "AI smartphone" products
- Inference engines and AI deployment

## THE LITMUS TEST
Would a student reading this article:
1. Learn how AI improves the DESIGN PROCESS?
2. See AI making engineers more productive?
3. Understand quantified improvements (faster, cheaper, better)?
4. Want to work on using AI to optimize systems?

If YES to all ‚Üí INCLUDE with enthusiasm!

## SEARCH STRATEGY

### Primary Queries:
```
"AI compiler optimization" -pytorch -tensorflow
"machine learning code optimization" -training -inference
"AI debugging tools" -gpu -accelerator
"automated code generation" performance improvement
"AI database optimization" query speedup
"machine learning EDA" design productivity
"AI chip design" layout automation
```

## OUTPUT FORMAT

### CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE
**ALWAYS make the article title the clickable link. NEVER add "Read more" or any other link text.**

**[Month Year]** - [Article Title](URL) - Impact-focused description with specific achievement.

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Example:
**Oct 2024** - [AI Compiler Reduces LLVM Build Time by 60%](https://example.com) - Machine learning optimization identifies bottlenecks and improves compilation speed from 10 minutes to 4 minutes for large codebases.

### ‚ùå WRONG Examples:
- Any article about PyTorch optimizations (software FOR AI)
- TPU architecture improvements (hardware FOR AI)
- AI training speedups (infrastructure FOR AI)

## SUCCESS METRICS
Each article must show AI IMPROVING the design/development process, not building better AI systems.
