# Phase 1: AI for Software
*AI systems understand what needs to be computed efficiently*

## Week 3 ‚Äî Code Generation & Software Engineering
**Week of September 15**

*Why are we studying this? Code generation is the most accessible entry point for AI in systems - it's where LLMs have shown dramatic success, but also where we can clearly see the gap between "impressive demos" and "production-ready tools." This week examines: How do we evaluate whether AI can actually replace human programmers? What does it mean for code to be "correct" vs. "optimal"? How do we move from toy problems to real software engineering workflows?*

## Week 4 ‚Äî Performance Engineering & Code Optimization
**Week of September 22**

*Why are we studying this? Moving beyond correctness to performance requires understanding both algorithmic complexity and system behavior. This week explores: Can AI learn the subtle performance optimizations that expert programmers use?

## Week 5 ‚Äî GPU Kernels & Parallel Programming
**Week of September 29**

*Why are we studying this? GPU kernel optimization sits at the intersection of domain expertise and automated optimization - a space too complex for pure heuristics but requiring deep hardware understanding. This week explores: Can AI learn hardware-specific optimization strategies that human experts use? How do we benchmark AI systems against decades of hand-tuned libraries?

## Week 6 ‚Äî Distributed Systems Integration
**Week of October 6**

*Why are we studying this? Distributed systems are the culmination of software engineering challenges - where code generation, performance optimization, and parallel programming must work together at scale. This week examines: How do we optimize systems where the bottleneck might be network latency, not computation? Can AI learn to co-design algorithms and system architecture? What does "optimal" mean when dealing with failures, load balancing, and resource contention?*
