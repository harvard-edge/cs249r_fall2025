# Survey Paper Project: Agentic AI for Computer Systems Design

## The Vision: Our Goal

**We are creating the definitive cross-stack survey on "Agentic AI for Computer Systems Design"** - the first comprehensive analysis that examines how AI agents are transforming computer systems design across the complete computing stack, from software optimization to chip design.

**Why This Matters**: Current research is fragmented across venues (ISCA, MICRO, DAC, MLSys, ICLR). No one has written the systematic cross-stack analysis that shows how these methodologies connect and where the field is heading holistically. This survey will establish the research agenda for the next decade.

**Target Impact**: Publication-quality paper suitable for top-tier venues like ISCA, MICRO, or Computer Architecture Letters.

## Your Role: Focused Vertical Analysis

### What Every Student Contributes

**You will be assigned to one vertical track (2-3 students per track) and must provide:**

1. **Comprehensive Literature Analysis** (20-25 key papers in your section)
2. **Data-Driven Insights** through systematic extraction and analysis of existing results
3. **Visual Synthesis** via tables, figures, and charts that reveal new patterns
4. **Cross-Stack Connections** linking your section to others

### Data-Driven Analysis Requirements

**The Pipeline Logic:**
- **Weeks 1-2 (Sep 3-15)**: Foundations & Architecture 2.0 + Group formation
- **Software group** starts intensive work in Weeks 3-5 (Sep 15 - Oct 1) while learning software topics
- **Architecture group** begins deep work in Weeks 6-9 (Oct 6-29) while learning architecture  
- **EDA group** starts intensive work in Weeks 10-12 (Nov 3-19) while learning EDA topics
