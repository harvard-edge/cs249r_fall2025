# Assignments & Deliverables

## Assignment Overview

This course emphasizes **active engagement** with cutting-edge research through three main components:

- **Paper Reading**: Critical analysis of research papers
- **Labs & Projects**: Hands-on work with AI-for-architecture tools
- **Discussion Leadership**: Facilitating class discussions

---

## 1. Paper Reading & Reflection (40%)

**Format**: 1-2 page written reflections on assigned readings  
**Due**: Before each class session  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate critical engagement with material and prepare for discussion

### Structure Guidelines
- **Summary**: What problem does the paper address and what is the key contribution?
- **Analysis**: What are the strengths, limitations, and questionable assumptions?
- **Connections**: How does this relate to other papers and course themes?

---

## 2. Labs & Projects (40%)

**Components**: 3-4 progressive assignments + final project contributing to **GenAISys**  
**Tools**: ArchGym, DREAMPlace, CompilerGym, and other AI-for-architecture frameworks  
**Goal**: Collectively build GenAISys - a unified modular agentic framework for AI-driven computer systems design

### Project Expectations
- Each student develops a specific component that fits into the GenAISys modular framework
- Components span the three thematic areas: AI for Software, AI for Architecture, AI for EDA
- Final presentations demonstrate how your component integrates with the larger GenAISys vision
- All projects contribute toward a single coherent research platform

---

## 3. Discussion Leadership (20%)

**Format**: Lead one class discussion session (individually or in pairs)  
**Duration**: 45-50 minutes of class session  
**Sign-up**: By Week 3

### Responsibilities
- **Preparation**: Meet with instructor 1 week before, prepare discussion questions
- **Facilitation**: Guide discussion, connect to course themes, synthesize insights
- **Follow-up**: Brief reflection on session effectiveness
