## 3. Collaborative Survey Paper Project (30%)

{: .course-goal}
> **📋 Complete Project Details**: For comprehensive information about the survey paper project, including detailed timeline, requirements, and examples, visit the dedicated **[Survey Project Page](project)**.

**Format**: Single comprehensive survey paper created collaboratively by all students  
**Scope**: "Agentic AI for Computer Systems Design: A Holistic Cross-Stack Perspective"  
**Goal**: Produce a publication-quality survey that synthesizes AI agent methodologies across the complete computing stack

### The Vision: Cross-Cutting Analysis

Rather than creating separate papers on individual topics, this class will produce **one comprehensive survey** that examines how AI agents are transforming computer systems design holistically—from software optimization to chip design. The value lies in identifying cross-cutting themes, methodological connections, and system-level insights that emerge when viewing these technologies as an integrated ecosystem.

### Why This Approach? The Value of Survey Research

**Research Skills Over Implementation**: Rather than coding assignments, this course emphasizes **research synthesis and critical analysis**—the core skills needed to advance the field of AI agents for computer systems design.

**🔍 Field-Shaping Impact**: The field of AI agents for computer systems is rapidly evolving with scattered research across venues (ISCA, MICRO, DAC, MLSys, ICLR, etc.). High-quality survey papers help consolidate knowledge, identify gaps, and guide future research directions.

**📊 Research Methodology**: Students develop crucial skills in systematic literature review, critical analysis, taxonomy development, gap identification, and technical writing for academic publication.

**🎯 Real Research Impact**: This survey is designed to be a **publication-quality** contribution suitable for top-tier venues like ISCA, MICRO, or Computer Architecture Letters—providing the field's first comprehensive cross-stack analysis of agentic AI methodologies.

### Project Structure & Timeline

**Survey Paper Pipeline**: The project follows a structured pipeline that aligns with course learning phases, allowing students to research topics as they learn them in class.

### Survey Structure: Cross-Stack Sections (2-3 students per section)

**The paper will examine agentic AI methodologies across three abstraction levels, with emphasis on cross-cutting themes and system-level insights:**

**Section 1: AI Agents for Software Systems**
- Code generation, optimization, and performance engineering
- Cross-cutting theme: *Agent-driven software-hardware co-optimization*

**Section 2: AI Agents for Architecture Design**  
- Performance prediction, design space exploration, and accelerator design
- Cross-cutting theme: *Multi-objective optimization and design trade-offs*

**Section 3: AI Agents for Physical Implementation**
- RTL synthesis, placement & routing, and verification
- Cross-cutting theme: *Constraint satisfaction and manufacturing considerations*

**Section 4: Cross-Stack Integration & Future Directions**
- Methodological connections, API design, and holistic system design
- Cross-cutting theme: *End-to-end agentic design workflows*

**Section 5: Evaluation Frameworks & Benchmarking**
- Comparative analysis, metrics, and reproducibility
- Cross-cutting theme: *Standardized evaluation across abstraction levels*

### Data-Driven Analysis Requirements

**Every student must contribute quantitative analysis and data visualization:**

**Required Analytical Contributions (flexible based on section needs):**
- **Systematic data extraction** from papers, GitHub repos, benchmark leaderboards, and conference proceedings
- **Synthesis tables and figures** that reveal patterns not visible in individual papers
- **Trend analysis and timeline visualizations** showing technique evolution and adoption
- **Performance landscape mapping** using aggregated results from multiple sources
- **Gap identification** through systematic coverage analysis of evaluation spaces

**Technical Work Guidelines:**
- **Data-driven approach**: Every major claim supported by tables, figures, or analysis
- **Code for analysis**: Scripts for data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis
- **Reproducible methodology**: Documented approach for extracting and analyzing data
- **Visual synthesis**: Charts, graphs, and tables that reveal new insights from existing data

**Concrete Examples of Data-Driven Contributions:**

**Software Section:**
- Comparative performance tables from HumanEval, MBPP, SWE-bench results across LLM code generators
- Timeline analysis of compiler optimization techniques adoption (2020-2025)
- GPU kernel performance comparison matrices from published benchmarks

**Architecture Section:**
- Design space exploration visualizations aggregated from accelerator papers
- Memory system performance trend analysis from ISCA/MICRO papers
- Energy-performance Pareto frontier analysis across AI accelerators

**Chip Design Section:**
- EDA tool capability comparison matrix (features, supported designs, performance)
- Synthesis QoR improvement trends over time from published results
- Verification coverage analysis across different AI-assisted approaches

**Integration Section:**
- Cross-stack methodology taxonomy with quantitative adoption analysis
- Timeline of end-to-end design flow evolution
- Gap analysis matrix showing unexplored cross-layer optimization opportunities

**The key insight**: Students extract, synthesize, and visualize data that already exists in the literature but hasn't been systematically compared or analyzed across the full stack.
