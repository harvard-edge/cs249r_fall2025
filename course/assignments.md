## 3. Group Survey Paper Project (40%)

**Format**: Collaborative research survey in teams of 2-3 students  
**Scope**: Focused analysis of specific subtopics within course themes  
**Goal**: Produce publication-quality survey papers that advance understanding of AI agents for computer systems design

{: .rationale-box}
### Why This Approach? The Value of Survey Research

**Research Skills Over Implementation**: Rather than coding assignments, this course emphasizes **research synthesis and critical analysis**‚Äîthe core skills needed to advance the field of AI agents for computer systems design.

**üîç Field-Shaping Impact**: The field of AI agents for computer systems is rapidly evolving with scattered research across venues (ISCA, MICRO, DAC, MLSys, ICLR, etc.). High-quality survey papers help consolidate knowledge, identify gaps, and guide future research directions.

**üìä Research Methodology**: Students develop crucial skills in systematic literature review, critical analysis, taxonomy development, gap identification, and technical writing for academic publication.

**üéØ Real Research Impact**: These surveys are designed to be **publication-quality** contributions suitable for ML4Sys workshops, computer architecture venues, or survey journals.

### Project Structure & Timeline

**Survey Paper Pipeline**: The project follows a structured pipeline that aligns with course learning phases, allowing students to research topics as they learn them in class.
