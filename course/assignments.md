# Assignments & Deliverables

## Assignment Overview

This course emphasizes **active engagement** with cutting-edge research through three main components:

- **Weekly Reading Reflections**: Individual critical analysis of research papers
- **Paper Presentations & Discussion Leadership**: Facilitating class discussions and synthesis
- **Group Survey Paper Project**: Collaborative research surveys advancing the field

---

## 1. Weekly Reading Reflections (30%)

**Format**: 1-2 page written reflections on assigned readings  
**Due**: Before each class session  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate critical engagement with material and prepare for discussion

### Structure Guidelines
- **Summary**: What problem does the paper address and what is the key contribution?
- **Analysis**: What are the strengths, limitations, and questionable assumptions?
- **Connections**: How does this relate to other papers and course themes?

---

## 2. Paper Presentations & Discussion Leadership (30%)

**Format**: Present and lead discussion for assigned papers (individually or in pairs)  
**Structure**: 20-minute presentation + 20-minute facilitated discussion per paper  
**Sign-up**: By Week 3

### Presentation Structure
**20-Minute Presentation:**
- Paper summary and key contributions (5-7 minutes)
- Critical analysis: strengths, limitations, methodology issues (8-10 minutes)
- Connections to course themes and other papers (3-5 minutes)

**20-Minute Discussion:**
- Facilitate Q&A and critical discussion
- Prepare 3-4 provocative discussion questions
- Guide synthesis and connections to broader themes

### Responsibilities
- **Preparation**: Meet with instructor 1 week before, prepare slides and discussion questions
- **Flexibility**: Timing may adjust based on guest speaker availability and class dynamics
- **Follow-up**: Brief reflection on presentation effectiveness and discussion insights

---

## 3. Group Survey Paper Project (40%)

**Format**: Collaborative research survey in teams of 4-5 students  
**Scope**: Comprehensive analysis of one thematic area from the course  
**Goal**: Produce publication-quality survey papers that advance understanding of ML for systems design

### Project Structure
**Three Survey Groups:**
- **Group 1**: AI for Software (Code generation, compiler optimization, distributed systems)
- **Group 2**: AI for Architecture (Processor design, memory systems, accelerators)  
- **Group 3**: AI for Chip Design (RTL synthesis, placement & routing, verification)

### Deliverables & Timeline
**Mid-Semester (Week 8):**
- Annotated bibliography of 25-30 key papers in your area
- 3-5 focused research questions your survey will address
- Preliminary taxonomy or framework for organizing the field

**Final Deliverable (Week 15):**
- 15-20 page survey paper with original analysis and insights
- 10-minute group presentation highlighting key findings
- Individual 2-page reflection on cross-stack connections and future research directions

### Survey Paper Requirements
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Systematic review of recent advances (2020-2025)
- **Critical Analysis**: Strengths, limitations, and gaps in current approaches
- **Original Insights**: Novel taxonomy, benchmarking analysis, or methodological comparison
- **Future Directions**: 3-5 concrete research opportunities identified
- **Publication Quality**: Suitable for submission to ML4Sys workshops or survey journals
