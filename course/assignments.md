# Assignments & Deliverables

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ“‹ Survey Paper Project Overview</strong></summary>

<br>

**We are creating the definitive cross-stack survey on "Agentic AI for Computer Systems Design"** - the first comprehensive analysis that examines how AI agents are transforming computer systems design across the complete computing stack, from software optimization to chip design.

<br>

**Why This Matters**: Current research is fragmented across venues (ISCA, MICRO, DAC, MLSys, ICLR). No one has written the systematic cross-stack analysis that shows how these methodologies connect and where the field is heading holistically.

<br>

**Target Impact**: Publication-quality paper suitable for top-tier venues like ISCA, MICRO, or Computer Architecture Letters.

### Tentative Paper Outline (20-25 pages)

**"Agentic AI for Computer Systems Design: A Holistic Cross-Stack Perspective"**

**1. Introduction** (1-2 pages)
- Problem motivation: Why generative AI changes everything for systems design
- Cross-stack perspective and unique contributions of this survey

**2. Background** (2-3 pages)
- Focus on **generative/agentic AI** (LLMs, diffusion models, RL agents)
- Distinction from traditional ML-driven approaches (which have existing surveys)
- Evolution from heuristic-based â†’ ML-driven â†’ agentic design paradigms

**3. Related Work** (2-3 pages)
- Existing surveys on ML for systems (what we're NOT doing)
- Gap analysis: Why cross-stack agentic perspective is missing
- Positioning our unique contribution

**4. Agentic AI for Software Systems** (3-4 pages)
- Code generation, optimization, and performance engineering
- *Team Focus: Software vertical*

**5. Agentic AI for Architecture Design** (3-4 pages)  
- Performance prediction, design space exploration, and accelerator design
- *Team Focus: Architecture vertical*

**6. Agentic AI for Physical Implementation** (3-4 pages)
- RTL synthesis, placement & routing, and verification
- *Team Focus: EDA vertical*

**7. Cross-Stack Integration & Future Directions** (2-3 pages)
- Methodological connections and system-level insights
- Research gaps and opportunities

**8. Conclusion** (1 page)
- Summary of key findings and impact

### Project Structure & Timeline

**Survey Paper Pipeline**: The project follows a structured pipeline that aligns with course learning phases, allowing students to research topics as they learn them in class.

## 1. Survey Paper Checkpoints

**Format**: Three milestone checkpoints  
**Purpose**: Progressive development and validation of your survey paper research  
**Timeline**: Aligned with course phases and survey paper development

### Checkpoint Structure
- **Checkpoint 1**: Literature survey - Comprehensive review of relevant papers in your section
- **Checkpoint 2**: Data-driven exercise - Gathering results, creating plots/tables, assembling raw data  
- **Checkpoint 3**: First draft of your section - Complete draft of your survey section

Each checkpoint focuses on **systematic research development**, building toward a publication-quality survey paper through structured milestones.

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ“‹ Checkpoint 1 Details: Literature Survey</strong></summary>

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive review of relevant papers in your section (4-5 pages)  
**Requirements**:
- 20-25 key papers identified with data extraction plan
- Cross-cutting themes and quantitative analysis opportunities identified
- Detailed plan for tables/figures to be generated from existing data
- Methodology for data collection and analysis documented

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ“Š Checkpoint 2 Details: Data-Driven Exercise</strong></summary>

**Deliverable**: Technical results with generated tables and figures (10-12 pages)  
**Requirements**:
- Completed data analysis with generated tables and figures
- Comparative analysis revealing new insights from existing literature
- Draft survey sections with quantitative findings integrated
- Cross-references and data connections to other sections identified

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ“– Checkpoint 3 Details: First Draft</strong></summary>
