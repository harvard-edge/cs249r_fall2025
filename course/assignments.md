# Assignments & Deliverables

## Assignment Overview

This course emphasizes **active engagement** with cutting-edge research through three main components:

- **Weekly Reading Reflections**: Individual critical analysis of research papers
- **Paper Presentations & Discussion Leadership**: Facilitating class discussions and synthesis
- **Group Survey Paper Project**: Collaborative research surveys advancing the field

---

**Format**: 1-2 page written reflections on assigned readings  
**Due**: Before each class session  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate critical engagement with material and prepare for discussion

### Structure Guidelines
- **Summary**: What problem does the paper address and what is the key contribution?
- **Analysis**: What are the strengths, limitations, and questionable assumptions?
- **Connections**: How does this relate to other papers and course themes?

---

## 2. Paper Presentations & Discussion Leadership (30%)

**Format**: Present and lead discussion for assigned papers (individually or in pairs)  
**Structure**: 20-minute presentation + 20-minute facilitated discussion per paper  
**Sign-up**: By Week 3

### Presentation Structure
**20-Minute Presentation:**
- Paper summary and key contributions (5-7 minutes)
- Critical analysis: strengths, limitations, methodology issues (8-10 minutes)
- Connections to course themes and other papers (3-5 minutes)

**20-Minute Discussion:**
- Facilitate Q&A and critical discussion
- Prepare 3-4 provocative discussion questions
- Guide synthesis and connections to broader themes

### Responsibilities
- **Preparation**: Meet with instructor 1 week before, prepare slides and discussion questions
- **Flexibility**: Timing may adjust based on guest speaker availability and class dynamics
- **Follow-up**: Brief reflection on presentation effectiveness and discussion insights

## 3. Group Survey Paper Project (40%)

**Format**: Collaborative research survey in teams of 4-5 students  
**Scope**: Comprehensive analysis of one thematic area from the course  
**Goal**: Produce publication-quality survey papers that advance understanding of AI agents for computer systems design

### Why This Approach? The Value of Survey Research

**Research Skills Over Implementation**: Rather than coding assignments, this course emphasizes **research synthesis and critical analysis**‚Äîthe core skills needed to advance the field of AI agents for computer systems design. Here's why:

**üîç Field-Shaping Impact**: The field of AI agents for computer systems is rapidly evolving with scattered research across venues (ISCA, MICRO, DAC, MLSys, ICLR, etc.). High-quality survey papers help consolidate knowledge, identify gaps, and guide future research directions.

**üìä Research Methodology**: Students develop crucial skills in:
- **Systematic literature review** and paper discovery across multiple domains
- **Critical analysis** of methodologies, strengths, and limitations
- **Taxonomy development** to organize complex, interdisciplinary research
- **Gap identification** and future research direction formulation
- **Technical writing** for academic publication

**üåê Cross-Stack Understanding**: By surveying an entire thematic area (Software/Architecture/EDA), students gain comprehensive understanding of how AI agents work across different abstraction levels‚Äîsomething impossible with narrow coding projects.

**üéØ Real Research Impact**: These surveys are designed to be **publication-quality** contributions that could be submitted to ML4Sys workshops, computer architecture venues, or survey journals. Students produce work that advances the field, not just coursework.

**ü§ù Collaborative Research Skills**: Working in teams mirrors real research collaboration, teaching students how to coordinate literature review, maintain consistency across sections, and integrate diverse perspectives into cohesive analysis.

### Project Structure
**Three Survey Groups:**
- **Group 1**: AI for Software (Code generation, compiler optimization, distributed systems)
- **Group 2**: AI for Architecture (Processor design, memory systems, accelerators)  
- **Group 3**: AI for Chip Design (RTL synthesis, placement & routing, verification)

### Individual Section Contribution Process

Each student will contribute **one major section** to their group's survey paper. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive coverage while developing individual expertise.

**Section Selection & Approval:**
- Students select specific subsection topics within their group's thematic area
- **Required**: Meet with TAs and instructor to discuss scope and approach
- Approval needed before proceeding to Checkpoint 1

### Pipeline-Based Checkpoint Timeline

**The checkpoint schedule aligns with course thematic progression‚Äîstudents begin survey work as we complete each section, creating a natural pipeline from learning to research synthesis.**
