# Course Syllabus

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Build** AI agents that can automatically design computer architectures across different abstraction levels
2. **Implement** reinforcement learning and neural network approaches for architecture optimization
3. **Evaluate** AI-driven design methodologies and compare them to traditional heuristic approaches
4. **Identify** promising research directions in AI-agent-driven architecture design
5. **Develop** tools and frameworks for automated architecture exploration and optimization

## Course Structure

This is a **research paper reading seminar** exploring AI agents across three thematic areas:

1. **AI for Software**: Software optimization and compilation
2. **AI for Architecture**: Hardware design and system architecture  
3. **AI for EDA**: Physical implementation and chip design

See the [Schedule](schedule.md) for detailed weekly topics and readings.

## Assignments & Grading

### Paper Reading & Reflection (40%)
- Weekly 1-2 page reflections on assigned papers
- Due before each class session
- Focus on critical analysis and connections to course themes

### Labs & Projects (40%)
- Hands-on assignments with tools like ArchGym, DREAMPlace, CompilerGym
- All projects contribute components to **GenAISys** - a unified modular agentic framework
- Progressive assignments building toward integrated final system

### Discussion Leadership (20%)
- Each student leads discussion for 1-2 sessions during the semester
- Prepare questions, facilitate debate, synthesize insights
- Sign up by Week 3

## Course Policies

### Attendance
Regular attendance essential for discussion-based seminar. More than two unexcused absences may result in grade reduction.

### Late Work
Reading reflections submitted late receive reduced credit. Extensions for major assignments require advance notice.

### Academic Integrity
All work must be original with proper citation. Collaboration encouraged for labs but individual work expected for reflections and final project.
