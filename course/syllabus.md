# Course Syllabus

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** AI agent methodologies for computer systems design across different abstraction levels
2. **Evaluate** AI-driven design approaches and compare them to traditional heuristic methods
3. **Synthesize** research findings through comprehensive literature review and survey writing
4. **Identify** promising research directions and gaps in AI-agent-driven architecture design
5. **Communicate** complex technical concepts through presentations and collaborative research

## Course Structure

This is a **research paper reading seminar** exploring AI agents across three thematic areas:

1. **AI for Software**: Software optimization and compilation
2. **AI for Architecture**: Hardware design and system architecture  
3. **AI for EDA**: Physical implementation and chip design

See the [Schedule](schedule.md) for detailed weekly topics and readings.
