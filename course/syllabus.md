# Course Syllabus

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** AI agent methodologies for computer systems design across different abstraction levels
2. **Evaluate** AI-driven design approaches and compare them to traditional heuristic methods
3. **Synthesize** research findings through comprehensive literature review and survey writing
4. **Identify** promising research directions and gaps in AI-agent-driven architecture design
5. **Communicate** complex technical concepts through presentations and collaborative research

## Course Structure

This is a **research paper reading seminar** exploring AI agents across three thematic areas:

1. **AI for Software**: Software optimization and compilation
2. **AI for Architecture**: Hardware design and system architecture  
3. **AI for EDA**: Physical implementation and chip design

See the [Schedule](schedule.md) for detailed weekly topics and readings.

## Course Policies

### Attendance
Regular attendance essential for discussion-based seminar. More than two unexcused absences may result in grade reduction.

### Late Work
- Survey paper checkpoints: 10% penalty per day late
- Survey paper project: Extensions require advance notice from entire team
- Discussion leadership: Must reschedule in advance

### Collaboration
- **Survey paper checkpoints**: Individual work within collaborative project framework
- **Survey paper project**: Required group work (entire class collaboration)
- **Discussion leadership**: Pairs allowed and encouraged

### Generative AI Policy

**Philosophy**: In a course dedicated to AI agents transforming computer systems design, we embrace the thoughtful use of generative AI tools while prioritizing fundamental learning.

**Permitted Use**:
- **Research assistance**: Using AI to help understand complex papers, generate initial literature searches, or clarify technical concepts
- **Writing support**: AI assistance for editing, structuring arguments, or improving clarity of your own ideas
- **Coding examples**: AI-generated code snippets for understanding implementation concepts discussed in papers

**Learning-First Approach**:
- **Develop fundamentals first**: Before using AI tools, engage deeply with the material yourself. AI should amplify your understanding, not replace it
- **Transparent attribution**: When AI significantly contributes to your work, acknowledge it (e.g., "Used GPT-4 to help structure the argument in Section 2.3")
- **Critical evaluation**: Always verify AI-generated content against primary sources and your own understanding

**Why This Matters**:
The goal isn't productivity—it's learning. AI tools are powerful accelerators, but they work best when you have strong foundational knowledge to guide and evaluate their output. In our seminar discussions, we want to hear *your* insights, questions, and connections, not AI-generated responses.

**In-Class Discussions**: Our seminar format prioritizes human dialogue and critical thinking. Come prepared to engage with your own questions, insights, and perspectives developed through direct engagement with the material.

### Academic Integrity
All work must be original with proper citation. Collaboration encouraged within the framework specified above.
