# Course Syllabus

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** AI agent methodologies for computer systems design across different abstraction levels
2. **Evaluate** AI-driven design approaches and compare them to traditional heuristic methods
3. **Synthesize** research findings through comprehensive literature review and survey writing
4. **Identify** promising research directions and gaps in AI-agent-driven architecture design
5. **Communicate** complex technical concepts through presentations and collaborative research

## Course Structure

This is a **research paper reading seminar** exploring AI agents across three thematic areas:

1. **AI for Software**: Software optimization and compilation
2. **AI for Architecture**: Hardware design and system architecture  
3. **AI for EDA**: Physical implementation and chip design

See the [Schedule](schedule.md) for detailed weekly topics and readings.

## Assignments & Grading

### Weekly Reading Reflections (30%)
- Weekly 1-2 page reflections on assigned papers
- Due before each class session
- Focus on critical analysis and connections to course themes

### Paper Presentations & Discussion Leadership (30%)
- Each student leads discussion for 1-2 sessions during the semester
- Present and lead discussion for assigned papers (individually or in pairs)
- Prepare questions, facilitate debate, synthesize insights
- Sign up by Week 3

### Group Survey Paper Project (40%)
- Collaborative research survey in teams of 4-5 students
- Teams focus on one area: AI for Software, AI for Architecture, or AI for Chip Design
- Individual section contributions with structured checkpoints
- Final: 15-20 page publication-quality survey paper + presentation

## Course Policies

### Attendance
Regular attendance essential for discussion-based seminar. More than two unexcused absences may result in grade reduction.

### Late Work
Reading reflections submitted late receive reduced credit. Extensions for major assignments require advance notice.

### Academic Integrity
All work must be original with proper citation. Collaboration encouraged for labs but individual work expected for reflections and final project.
